The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there can be unexpected results if the calculation involves units that are not consistent or if there are unexpected whitespace issues in the calculation.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px);` (note the space after 20) will likely fail.  Another common issue is mixing percentages and pixels in ways that may lead to unexpected layouts, particularly when the parent element doesn't have a defined size.
